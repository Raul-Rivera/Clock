# Clock

    I made a Clock program with Java. The program has a driver with I made 10 diferent clocks
	in diferent ways. The program has 3 constructors, one constructor can work with 3 variables,
	hours, minutes and seconds. The other constructor can work with 5 variables, hours, minutes, 
	seconds, ap (can be 'AM' or 'PM') and z (for location, can be 'GMT', 'EST', 'CST', 'RST' and 'PST'),
	the other is a default constructor with the same name than the class. Also this program has a method
	called 'tick' with which the time can increase one second to check that the clock is working well.
